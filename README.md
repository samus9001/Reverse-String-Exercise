# Reverse String

### Description

- This program takes the user's input of letters that make a word, and outputs it in reverse order.
- This program can be used to see what a word looks like written backwards as well as to check if a given word is a palindrome.
- The program uses a for loop to look at the length of the given string and then decreases the value of the variable in the loop condition in order to stop it from executing once all the letters have been run through, and then does a string comparison check to see if the word is a palindrome.

### Inspiration

This is a simple program that was made as an exercise to learn how strings can be used in C# with the command line.

### Getting Started

To use the program run the ReverseString.exe file then input any word or combination of letters into the console window and press the Enter key to see the output.
